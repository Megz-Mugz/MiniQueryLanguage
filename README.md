Currently an ongoing project where I am aiming to make a **lexer**, **parser**, and p**erform semantic analysis** for an in-memory mock database engine. 

While I want to eventually extend this project to be a full fledged relational database engine, [similar to this video](https://youtu.be/5Pc18ge9ohI?si=yqO0x9kQlstSBQu5), where I store tables on the disk and users can interface with the database via a TCP connection, I want the first iteration of this project to focus more on the compiler design & implementation with basic SQL commands like CREATE, UPDATE, DESTROY. 

While I don't have any formal education regarding compiler design or implementation (yet) I am slowly learning things from textbooks, YouTube videos, and anything else I find on the internet regarding how I can properly make a compiler for a mini query language.
