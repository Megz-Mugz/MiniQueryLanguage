Currently an ongoing project where I am aiming to make a lexer, parser, and perform semantic analysis for an in-memory mock database engine. While I want to eventually extend this project to be a full fledged relational database engine, [similar to this video](https://youtu.be/5Pc18ge9ohI?si=yqO0x9kQlstSBQu5), where I store tables on the disk and users can interface with the database via a TCP connection, I want the first iteration of this project to focus more on the compiler design & implementation with basic SQL commands like CREATE, UPDATE, DESTROY.
